# Folder Publisher

This Lightroom “Publish” plugin allows you to export copies of your Lightroom photos to disk in a folder hierarchy that mimics the folder hierarchy in your Lightroom catalog. I've found it very useful in mirroring my Lightroom catalog as small JPGs on my wife's computer.

The plugin is normally used in the following pattern:

- Initial setup of the publish service.
- Populate the default collection with image you want to mirror, or create a smart collection that identifies the images you want to mirrors.
- “Publish” them, causing copies of the images to be reflected into a hierarchy on disk matching the folder hierarchy in Lightroom.
- Going forward, any time changes are made (images updated, added, or removed), “Publish” causes those changes to be reflected on disk.
